            According to the Devi Bhagavata Purana, Madhu and Kaitabha originated from Vishnu's earwax, and performed a
            long period of tapas devoted to the goddess Mahadevi, employing the Vāgbīja mantra. The goddess granted them
            the boon of death befalling them only with their consent. The proud asuras then started attacking Brahma,
            and stole the Vedas, hiding themselves in Patala. Brahma sought Vishnu's help, and eulogised the deity in
            order to awaken him. The two asuras then fought against Vishnu, and were undefeated. Upon advice from
            Mahadevi, Vishnu employed deceit to destroy the two asuras. Vishnu praised the powers of the two asuras,
            and said that he would be pleased to grant them boons. Laughing, the boastful asuras, proud of their
            victories against Vishnu, said that they were willing to grant him boons instead. Vishnu cleverly asked
            Madhu and Kaitabha for the boon of slaying them.
            <br>
            Defeated, the asuras requested Vishnu to be slain at any location except in the water, believing that they
            would still be invincible upon land. They were subsequently vanquished by Vishnu with his Sudarshana Chakra

            Mahishasura was a half-buffalo demon who did severe penance in order to please Brahma, the creator. After
            several years, Brahma, pleased with his devotion, appeared before him. The demon opened his eyes and asked
            the god for immortality. Brahma refused, stating that all must die one day. Mahishasura then thought for a
            while and asked a boon that only a woman could be able to kill him. Brahma granted the boon and disappeared.
            Mahishasura started to torture innocent people. He captured Svarga and was not in any kind of fear, as he
            thought women to be powerless and weak. The devas were worried and they went to Trimurti. The Trimurti
            combined their power, and gave a physical form to the sum of their divine energy, Adi Shakti, a warrior
            woman with many arms. Himavan, the personification of the Himalayas, gifted a lion as her mount. Durga, on
            her lion, appeared before Mahishasura where the demon took on different forms and attacked the goddess. Each
            time, Durga would destroy his forms. At last, Durga slew Mahishasura with her trident when he was
            transforming as a buffalo demon.

            The Devi Mahatmyam describes that the goddess Kaushiki appeared from the sheath (or kosha) of the goddess
            Parvati’s body when the devas sang her praises after she defeated the asuras Shumbha and Nishumbha. Their
            eulogies that were intended to be a plea for help caused her to manifest from Parvati's form as a
            fair-skinned and bright being, earning the epithet 'Gauri'. The fact that she had been created from the
            cells of Parvati caused her to name herself Kaushiki, literally meaning 'woman of the cell'. With the
            fairness of her skin separated from her form, Parvati became dark-skinned and assumed the name of Kali. The
            deities went their separate ways, with Kaushiki departing to the Himalayas. The minions of the asura
            brothers, Chanda and Munda, caught a glimpse of Kaushiki and rushed to urge Shumbha to claim her. With the
            help of the Matrikas, who were the female forms of the Trimurti, consisting of Brahmani, Vaishnavi, and
            Maheshwari, along with Varahi, Narasimhi, and Shakti, and her other half, the goddess Chamunda (Kali),
            Kaushiki and her forces fought the asuras in a pitched battle in order to vanquish them and restore the
            natural order. Following this, Parvati performed a penance in the Himalayas to restore her shakti and
            complexion before reuniting with Shiva.
